-------RSLO Use-------

Once you have your gear the way you would like open the rslo gui from the ammo box. Select and empty loadout from the list box. Then type a new name into the Loadout name box. Then hit save loadout.

Then you will be able to retrieve this loadout even after you leave the game and re-connect.

If you wish to delete a load out just select it from the box on the left and hit the delete loadout button.

If you wish to re-name a loadout select it from the left and type the new name into the text box and hit the re-name button.
